# Sets is the collection of well defined objects (non- repetitive elements)
# cannot to change the items in change and unindexed
# If you want to create an empty set then use the below way-
e = set()

# No. will not repeate in the set
s = {1, 5, 32, 54,5, 5, 5} 

 # Dont use s = {} as it will create an empty dictionary

print(s)
print(type(s))
